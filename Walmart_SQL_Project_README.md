## üß† Business Problems & SQL Solutions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Payment Method Analysis
**Question:** What are the different payment methods, and how many transactions and items were sold with each method?  
```sql
SELECT 
  payment_method, 
  COUNT(invoice_id) AS no_of_transactions, 
  SUM(quantity) AS no_quantity_sold 
FROM walmart
GROUP BY 1;
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Category with Highest Average Rating per Branch
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT branch,
    category,
    AVG(rating) AS avg_rating,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY branch ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC) AS rank
  FROM walmart
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
WHERE rank = 1;
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Busiest Day of the Week per Branch
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 
    branch,
    TO_CHAR(date, 'Day') AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_transaction,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY branch ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
  FROM walmart
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
WHERE rank = 1;
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Items Sold per Payment Method
```sql
SELECT 
  payment_method, 
  SUM(quantity) AS no_quantity_sold 
FROM walmart
GROUP BY 1;
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ratings Summary by Category & City
```sql
SELECT 
  city,
  category, 
  AVG(rating) AS avg_rating,
  MIN(rating) AS min_rating,
  MAX(rating) AS max_rating 
FROM walmart
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Total Profit by Category (Ranked)
```sql
SELECT 
  category, 
  ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity)::numeric, 2) AS total_profit
FROM walmart
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Most Frequent Payment Method per Branch
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 
    branch, 
    payment_method,
    COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY branch ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
  FROM walmart
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
WHERE rank = 1;
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Transactions per Shift
```sql
SELECT 
  branch,
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time) BETWEEN 12 AND 18 THEN 'Afternoon'
    ELSE 'Evening'
  END AS shift,
  COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM walmart
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC;
```

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Year-over-Year Revenue Comparison
**Question:** Which branches experienced the largest decrease in revenue compared to the previous year?  
```sql
WITH revenue_2022 AS (
  SELECT 
    branch,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity)::numeric, 2) AS total_profit
  FROM walmart
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = 2022
  GROUP BY branch, year
),
revenue_2023 AS (
  SELECT 
    branch,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity)::numeric, 2) AS total_profit
  FROM walmart
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = 2023
  GROUP BY branch, year
)
SELECT 
  ly.branch,
  ly.total_profit AS last_year,
  cy.total_profit AS current_year,
  ROUND(((cy.total_profit - ly.total_profit) / ly.total_profit) * 100, 2) AS percent_change
FROM revenue_2022 ly
JOIN revenue_2023 cy ON ly.branch = cy.branch
ORDER BY percent_change DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
